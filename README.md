# md-unisys-brand-values
Mobile app for employees of Unisys to view the brand values of the company - built through Twixl using HTML/CSS, Jquery, Jquery libraries, and JavaScript

Damn, this was a fun project!

Some thing I was responsible for were:
1. Making the container for each section responsive
2. Dictate how people move through the content
3. Integrate SketchFab and 3D scenee
4. Utilize jQuery plugins to achieve desired effect (Mission is a good example)
5. Use HTML5 video and change them out on gesture
6. Client relations - I actually got to colab with the people at Unisys!

I learned a lot at Marcolina Design, and not just from this project. Check out the others!
